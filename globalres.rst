Resolutions
===========

The *Resolutions* node allows you to globally set your bake and output
resolutions rather than set each pass individually. Only one such node
can be set *Active* at a time, but more than one can be present in a
tree. Individual passes and outputs can have a local overriding value
set if desired to ignore the global value. The local settings are also
used if no global node is present or active.
