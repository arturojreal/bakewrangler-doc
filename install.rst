Install & Update
================

There are no special steps required to install the add-on.
Simply open your blender preferences, navigate to the *Add-ons*
tab (left column) and click the '*Install...*' button near the
top right. In the '*File View*' that opens navigate to the location
of the Bake Wrangler zip file and click '*Install Add-on*' with
it selected or double click on the zip file.

Once installed you need to check the box on the add-on to enable it.

**Updating:**

When updating follow the same procedure (making sure the '*Overwrite*'
box is checked in the '*File Viewer*' when selecting the new version).
Sometimes changes are made the require blender to be restarted, though
I try to avoid this, it is a good idea to do so after updating if things
don't seem to be working right.

If an update changes the node tree in some way, out of date trees will
be updated when they are loaded. If a tree is already open when you update
or load a .blend it won't be updated until something causes it to be re-read.
Selecting it from the tree list or changing the tree both cause an update.
