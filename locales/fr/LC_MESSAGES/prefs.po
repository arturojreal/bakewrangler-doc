"**Messages to Text editor** (*enabled by default*) causes messages and "
"errors produced by Bake Wrangler to be written to a text file named "
"'*BakeWrangler*' in the current project. When disabled these messages "
"would only be visible in the console. |br|"

#: ../../prefs.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Clear Old Messages** (*enabled by default*) clears the text file prior "
"to each bake, so that messages are only relevant to the current/last "
"process. |br|"

#: ../../prefs.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Open Text in new Window** (*enabled by default*) will open a new window"
" when a bake process starts, displaying the text file (which is "
"continually updated). The size and location of the window will match the "
"Bake Node Editor from which the bake was started. (Note: The window must "
"be closed manually and will not be reused)"

"*The intention of the above preferences is to allow the user to create a "
"work space with the text file already open in it (would disable the pop "
"up window). Or to just see it when starting a bake (default). And of "
"course to be able to completely disable the system if they prefer the "
"console.*"

msgid ""
"**Save each Pass:** (*disabled by default*) causes the output to be saved"
" after each bake pass instead of after all contributing passes. This will"
" reduce performance in some cases (especially with Alpha being written "
"every time), but will preserve pass data in the event of a later failure "
"or memory shortage. Use it if some pass data seems to be getting lost or "
"if you have very long pass bake times so as not to lose progress. |br|"

#: ../../prefs.rst:36
msgid ""
"**Debug** (*disabled by default*) adds more detailed messages to each "
"process and if a bake fails with an error condition a complete process "
"log will be opened in a new window. **Please post this log when reporting"
" a bug.**"
