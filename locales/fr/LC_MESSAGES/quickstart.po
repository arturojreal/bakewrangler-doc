"**Target:** is the object you want to **bake to**. It must be a '*MESH*' "
"type object with a UV Map. A list of objects can also be connected here "
"which would cause each object in the list to be baked with the same "
"settings. This field must be filled. |br|"

"**Source:** is the object you want to **bake from**. The field is "
"optional and if left empty the data will be taken from the target object."
" Most renderable objects can be used as the target and a list of objects "
"can be connected. If multiple objects are selected then **all** of them "
"will be applied to each target (if there are multiple targets). |br|"

"which direction is mapped to the three color channels. |br|"

"the current path*). |br|"
