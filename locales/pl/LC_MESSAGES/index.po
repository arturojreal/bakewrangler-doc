"Productivity features for large/complex bakes to allow grouping of values"

"**Bake Passes** - Many additional passes are very simple to add at this "
"point, though some remain technically challenging. Adding passes will be "
"driven by user feedback and demand. |br|"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:47
msgid ""
"**Image Manipulation** - While not currently implemented, it would be "
"possible to combine passes using a maths function. Similarly some post "
"processing could be done on the images. There are some performance "
"limitations imposed by Python and I'm not entirely sure how useful it "
"would be. But it's certainly possible if users have a strong case for "
"something. |br|"
