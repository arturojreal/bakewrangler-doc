"The *Mesh* node is responsible for mesh specific settings and the "
"relationship between objects. It can take :doc:`objects` nodes as any of "
"its inputs, and outputs to a :doc:`pass` node. Only objects that are "
"linked to this node will be included in a bake pass and will be "
"completely isolated from all other objects in the .blend file."

"**Margin:** Number of pixels to extend out around the edges of baked UV "
"islands. This is used to prevent bleeding of background colors into "
"texture island edges when a coordinate lies on a pixel boundary or when a"
" texture is re-sampled at a different resolution. |br|"
msgstr ""

#: ../../mesh.rst:19
msgid ""
"**Mask Margin:** If masking is enabled this sets how many pixels the mask"
" should extend beyond the UV islands margin. Normally this can be set to "
"zero, but is provided in case a mask is cutting off edges. |br|"

msgid ""
"**Ray Distance:** Sets the distance in blender units that baking rays "
"should be cast from above the objects surface. This only applies when "
"baking from one or more *Source* objects. It needs to be far enough away "
"to hit any details that extend above the surface of the *Target*. When "
"finer control is required a *cage* object should be specified on the "
"*Target* object. |br|"

#: ../../mesh.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Target:** May be a single 'MESH' type object or taken from a "
":doc:`objects` node. When a list of objects is used, only 'MESH' type "
"objects will be considered with other types ignored. Each *Target* will "
"be baked in its own pass but shares the *Mesh* nodes settings. At least "
"one valid object must be selected for a bake to valid. |br|"
msgstr ""

#: ../../mesh.rst:40
msgid ""
"**Source:** Optional field that can take a single object of most types or"
" a list of objects from a :doc:`objects` node. All of *Source* objects "
"will have their surface data projected onto to the *Target(s)* (if "
"sensible for the selected bake pass). Normally a ray distance greater "
"than zero is needed to capture everything correctly. |br|"

#: ../../mesh.rst:47
msgid ""
"**Scene:** Optional field that can take a single collection or a list of "
"objects from a :doc:`objects` node. This is the only input that will "
"consider lights as valid objects. This input is used to set up lighting, "
"shadow casting objects and anything that indirectly influences the pass "
"but isn't directly mapped to the *Target*. Generally unless you are "
"trying to capture lighting information this input is not needed."
