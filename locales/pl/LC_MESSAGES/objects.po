"The *Objects* nodes role is to contain lists of objects and collections "
"which are used by the :doc:`Mesh </mesh>` nodes input sockets. *Objects* "
"nodes can be chained together and the node itself will continue to expand"
" as objects are added, allowing for any number and combination of "
"objects."

"Some objects have additional options that can be set once they are added."
" This is where **Cages** and **UV Maps** are configured."

"**Filter:** Selects what object types will be shown in the search boxes "
"and starts with all types enabled. |br|"

"**Collections:** Toggles between selecting objects or collections. The "
"node can contain a mixture of both, but can only search for one or the "
"other."

"*Note: If an object is contained in both a selected collection and "
"specifically listed, the specific listing will take preference. It is "
"also possible to list the same object multiple times with different "
"settings (UV Map and/or Cage), in which case it will be evaluated "
"multiple times.*"

"**Cage:** When the selected object can support a cage (*'MESH' type "
"objects*), this button will appear at the end of its row. Toggling the "
"button will enable using a cage for that object when baking (*if using a "
"cage makes sense for the bake*). The cage object must have the same "
"number of vertex as the original after all modifiers are taken into "
"account. On click it will automatically search for and select an object "
"that has the same name as the original plus a spacing character follow by"
" 'cage' (*Eg. cube.cage*). |br|"

#: ../../objects.rst:35
msgid ""
"**UV Map:** Allows selection of a specific *UV Map* to use for the "
"object. This option only appears when the object is able to support "
"multiple maps (*Currently that is 'MESH' type objects*). When left blank "
"or disabled the currently active map is used. Removing or renaming the "
"referenced map on the object will break the reference and must be "
"manually updated before baking can start. |br|"

"**Recursive Selection:** When the selected item is a collection this "
"option will appear. Enabling it will cause any and all sub collections of"
" the primary selection to also be included."
