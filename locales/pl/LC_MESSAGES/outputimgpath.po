"The *Output Image Path* node specifies where an image should be saved, "
"the name to use and all the file format information. Currently it is the "
"only output path for a bake. It takes color or value data from one or "
"more :doc:`pass` nodes as input. Each input is written to the final image"
" in the order they appear, such that if you used the *Color* input and "
"the *R* input (assuming none of the input data had *Masks* assigned) the "
"*R* input would override every *Red* value of the *Color* input. Writing "
"to the *A* (Alpha) channel requires an image format that supports alpha "
"to be chosen or it will be ignored. Writing alpha also takes slightly "
"longer and is performed in a separate pass once colors are written. An "
"output is provided for linking to one or more :doc:`batchbake` nodes if "
"desired."

"**Bake Image Button:** After validating settings this will cause all "
"connected :doc:`passes </pass>` to be performed, mixed together and saved"
" to the output file. This is the primary method for starting a non-batch "
"bake. For the differences with the similar *Bake Pass* button take a look"
" at the :doc:`egpassvimg` example. |br|"

"**Image Path:** Simply used to select the path where the image will be "
"saved. Relative paths may be used (*eg. // to refer to the path the "
".blend file is in*). |br|"

"**Image Name:** The name of the image with or without the extension. The "
"extension will be added for the currently selected file format unless you"
" have given the file an extension that isn't recognized (*eg. if format "
"was set to 'JPEG' both 'img' and 'img.png' would be saved as 'img.jpg' "
"but 'img.myext' would not be changed*). |br|"

"settings) before writing bake data. |br|"

"**Use 32 Bit Float:** Normally blender renders images using 8bits per "
"channel per pixel (24bpp or 32bpp with Alpha). If you want to save your "
"output in a format with more data per pixel than that you need to enable "
"this option. All contributing :doc:`passes </pass>` will then use 92bpp "
"(128bpp with Alpha). This uses up 4x more memory than standard, but can "
"be useful for *data* maps (eg. normals) to allow more variations in color"
" (and hence a more accurate representation of the data). For plain color "
"maps it generally doesn't provide any advantages. You must also use an "
"image format and bit depth with higher than 8bpp or the extra data will "
"be lost and colors may appear different than expected as they are "
"remapped to a lower bit depth. |br|"

"**Format:** Drop down list of supported image formats. This will default "
"to the output format selected for your current scene when placing the "
"node. The options in section *[7]* will change depending on the format "
"chosen. |br|"

msgid ""
"**X and Y Resolution:** Set the width and height in pixels of the final "
"output image. Using a lower value than the bake pass allows for down "
"sampling. Note that for performance reasons most real time rendering "
"engines will expect your texture maps to be a power of two (*eg. 512, "
"1024, 2048, 4096, etc*). Also consider that you can always reduce the "
"detail/size of a higher resolution map, but it's not really possible to "
"increse the detail in a lower resolution map. |br|"

"**Format Options:** This group of options are specific to the chosen "
"image format and will change accordingly. Almost all formats support "
"'*Color Space*', if you are unsure what to pick use '*sRGB*' for color "
"information and '*Non-Color*' for data maps like normals. For any other "
"settings either use the defaults or check the tool-tip for more "
"information if you are unsure. |br|"
